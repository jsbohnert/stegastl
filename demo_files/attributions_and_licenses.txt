`3DBenchy_Stega_Demo.stl` is modified via the stegaSTL project to embed an easter egg file
  (a representation of another creative work) that can be retrieved at bit depth 5.
  The specific details of its attribution can be found in the embedded file's standard metadata
  via any popular program which supports it, and is not copied here in the interest of joy for anyone who wants to find it.

  Safety Note: the embedded file is non-encrypted, and is not an executable nor does it contain any code.
  It is a hand-rolled piece of media content. Hint: VLC will show you what kind of media it is.
  Rename it to its proper extension and VLC will also display its metadata and its attribution info.
