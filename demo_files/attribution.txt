`3DBenchy.stl` was procured from https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:763622/files,
  having been released under Creative Commons CC0 and is shared here as reference data.

`3DBenchy_Stego_Demo.stl` is modified via the stlstego project to embed an easter egg file
  (a representation of another creative work) that can be retrieved at bit depth 5.
  The specific details of its attribution can be found in the embedded file's standard metadata
  via any popular program which supports it, and is not reproduced here in the interest of joy.

  Safety Note: the embedded file is non-encrypted, and is not an executable nor does it contain any code.
  It is a hand-rolled piece of media content. Hint: VLC will show you what kind of media it is.
  Rename it to its proper extension and VLC will also display its metadata.

Thanks go out to the creators and artists which provide these resources to the world.
